# Spoody-Queue
Discord-Based Queue W/ Minigames, Configurable Images, Links, &amp; Configurable Names!

# How To Install
1. Drag & Drop "Spoody-Queue" Into your resources folder.
2. Properly Configure the Config. (Bot Token, Roles, Etc)
3. Start In Server.CFG!
4. Enjoy! (Don't forget to change the links in postcard.json!)

# Notes
1. No-One can "dump" your server and grab your token from there, this happens when developers set their code as "client" sided or "shared", this code is marked as "server" sided
which means no-one can access this with dumping!
